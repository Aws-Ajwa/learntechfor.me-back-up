But you may ask your self now what is *composer* ?
*composer* is the Dependency manager for your project  which is (a software modules that coordinate the integration of external libraries or packages into larger application stack) in a simple way to say it that *composer* is used to declare the libraries of the project and manages them (install / update).

a lot to understand but you won't use the definition as much as you think just understand the main concept.

And we will continue in this series until we be experts in Laravel
