# Hello World

PHP is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used by millions of developers to create dynamic websites and web applications. 
PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the server before the web page is sent to the browser.
 PHP is free to download and use, and it is easy to learn for beginners.
There is no standard way to make a PHP file. However, most PHP files are created using a text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to write a PHP script to display "Hello, World!" on a web page.
But before that, you could ask how to set up my pc to start coding in PHP.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to set up your PC for coding in PHP may vary depending on your individual needs and preferences. However, some tips on how to set up your PC for coding in PHP include installing a text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom, as well as a local development environment such as XAMPP or MAMP. You may also find it helpful to install a PHP linter such as PHP_CodeSniffer or a code formatter such as PHP Coding Standards Fixer.
We will use the built-in PHP function echo to print the string "Hello World!" on the screen.

Here is the code:

```
<?php

echo "Hello World!";

?>
```

Save the above code in a file with the name helloworld.php and put it in your web server's document root directory. Now open your web browser and access the file using the URL http://localhost/helloworld.php. You should see the string "Hello World!" printed on the screen.

That's it! You have successfully written and executed your first PHP program.
