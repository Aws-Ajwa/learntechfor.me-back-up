## 8. Strings: PHP has a set of built-in functions to handle strings.
## 9. Web-forms: To create a form in HTML, you can use the  and  tags.
To process a form in PHP, you can use the $_GET or $_POST variables.
## 10. Sessions: A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.

 example of Cookies:
``` 
<code>&lt;?php
$cookie_name = "user";
$cookie_value = "John Doe";
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day
?&gt;
</code>
```

## 13. require: The required statement includes and evaluates the specified file.
## 14. File Handling: PHP has several powerful built-in functions that allow you to work with files.
